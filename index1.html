    <p> BLINDNESS Having a blind cat may be easier than you think, as cats already rely on other senses quite a bit anyway. Believe it or not, you do not have to do much to accommodate a blind cat. Sometimes cat owners donâ€™t realize their kitten is blind for a while, because behavior like running into objects or having trouble locating things may just seem kitten-like. One thing you can do for your blind cat is to keep things like the feeding dish, water and litter boxes in the same place. This way, your cat can rely on memory to find what he or she needs.</p>
